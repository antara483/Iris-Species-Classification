## 🌸 Iris Species Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project classifies iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
The project also includes data preprocessing, model evaluation, and a visualization of KNN decision boundaries.

### 📘 Dataset

The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning, containing 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features:

- Sepal Length

- Sepal Width

- Petal Length

- Petal Width

Each sample belongs to one of three species:

- Iris setosa

- Iris versicolor

- Iris virginica

### ⚙️ Project Workflow

#### 1. Loaded the Iris dataset using sklearn.datasets

#### 2. Explored and cleaned the dataset (removed duplicates)

#### 3. Standardized features using StandardScaler

#### 4. Trained a KNN model (n_neighbors=5)

#### 5. Evaluated performance using:

- Accuracy score

- Confusion matrix

- Classification report

#### 6. Visualized:

- Decision boundaries

- K-value vs Accuracy curve

#### 7. Understanding the bias-variance tradeoff using K vs Accuracy plot
